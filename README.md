I wrote this code through Visual Studio and ran it by using Live Server extension in Visual Studio

This is a glass bending calculator. In order to bend glass properly, you should know five variables:

1) Radius
2) Span
3) Girth
4) Angle
5) Rise

It is possible to find all five variables by knowing any of five combinations of two variables: Span and Rise, Span and Radius, Radius and Rise, Radius and Girth, Radius and Angle.

This program calculates all five variables by using any of these five combinations. In addition to that, it also calculates area and weight of the glass itself, and gives a warning if the angle is bigger than 90 degrees, because in that case, the glass will break under its' own weight.

Order ID will be used in the future. I am currently working on creating a printing template for this javascript program.
